# Project-Template-Godot

Today, I built a first 3D game using Godot. I tried a lot to add 'juciness' to my first person shooter; however, it was far beyond my knowledge. I eventually followed the video given on annoucenment: https://youtu.be/-9jO57rE5s0. After completing the project, I committed to master. After that, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
