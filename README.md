# Project-Template-Godot

Today, I built a first 3D game using Godot. I exactly followed the video given on annoucenment: https://youtu.be/-9jO57rE5s0. 

Copying the file took longer than I thought. I hope whoever plays this game enjoys playing. After completing the project, I committed to master. After that, I edited LICENSE and README.md.
